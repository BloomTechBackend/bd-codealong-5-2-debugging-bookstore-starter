# Bookstore Case 2: Checking Inventory

Scenario
--------

Use Case: As Bookstore employees, we want to be able to check the current quantity in stock for a particular title, so that we can decide when to order more of a particular title.

Case 2 Class: InventoryChecker

Responsible for checking the current quantity of a particular title in our inventory.

### Instructions

**Bug reports:**Â employees report that books out of stock, or maybe uncommon titles seem to cause errors. See if you can trace through the code and find the bug.

Walk through the code together, screen sharing if your group finds that helpful to keep in sync.

Use the sample data from CASE 1 as a starting point for your inventory data.
